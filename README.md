Information-Gravity Coupling Visualizer

This repository contains a Python-based visualization tool that provides a numerical toy model for the theory proposed in the paper "When the Universe Deletes Data, Gravity Remembers" (Gashash, 2025). The script simulates the emergence of a dark matter-like gravitational halo as a direct consequence of the thermodynamic cost of information erasure during galaxy formation.

It demonstrates how a causal-response framework, rooted in fundamental principles of information theory, can generate a gravitational field that accounts for the observed "missing mass" in galaxies without invoking new exotic particles.

The Core Hypothesis: A Primer

To understand what this code demonstrates, one must grasp the central thesis connecting information, energy, and gravity.

The Problem: The Ghost in the Galaxy

For decades, astronomers have observed that galaxies rotate much faster than they should. The visible matter (stars, gas, dust) doesn't provide enough gravity to hold them together at these speeds. The conventional solution is Dark Matter—an invisible, non-interactive substance that provides the extra gravitational pull. Despite decades of searching, no such particle has been definitively found.

A New Perspective: Information is Physical

Our model explores an alternative, phenomenological approach rooted in a profound discovery from the 20th century: information is not just an abstract concept; it is physically real and has energy costs.

This is encapsulated by Landauer's Principle.

Landauer's Principle: The Cost of Forgetting

In 1961, Rolf Landauer demonstrated that erasing one bit of information in a system at temperature T has a minimum, unavoidable energy cost, dissipated as heat:

E ≥ kB T ln(2)

Think of it this way: when you delete a photo from your phone, the device performs a physical action that releases a tiny, non-zero amount of heat into the universe. Forgetting has a physical price.

The Causal Link: From Erasure to Emergent Gravity

The paper's central idea applies this principle on a cosmic scale. During the chaotic process of galaxy formation, nature is constantly "deleting" information through processes like:

Coarse-graining: Microscopic details are lost as gas clouds collapse into uniform stars.

Decoherence: Quantum possibilities collapse into a single classical reality.

Thermalization: Ordered systems become chaotic, erasing their initial state.

The Hypothesis: While most of the energy cost from this cosmic information erasure dissipates quickly as heat, a small fraction, ζ, might be channeled into long-lived, stable, and electromagnetically "dark" energy fields. These "slow sectors" or "protected modes" don't shine or interact with light, but because they possess energy (E=mc²), they gravitate.

This "information field" is not a particle but an emergent property of spacetime itself, responding to the history of information processing within it. It acts as a memory of past erasure events, contributing to the total gravitational potential.

Mermaid Diagram Code:

A[Galaxy Formation (Gas collapse, star formation, mergers)] --> B{Massive Information Erasure (Coarse-graining, decoherence)};
B --> C[Landauer's Principle E = k_B T ln(2) per bit];
C --> D{Branching Ratio ζ};
D -- 1-ζ --> E[Fast Thermalization (Heat)];
D -- ζ --> F[Slow, Protected Modes (Long-lived energy reservoir)];
F --> G[Gravitational Influence (Acts like extra mass)];
G --> H[Observed Galactic Dynamics (Flat rotation curves, strong lensing)];

This model therefore re-frames "dark matter" not as a thing, but as the gravitational echo of information being forgotten.

What This Code Does

The Python script (visualize_info_gravity.py) provides a tangible, visual representation of this hypothesis. It performs the following steps:

Creates a Baryonic Galaxy: It generates a 3D density grid representing a simplified spiral galaxy made of normal (baryonic) matter.

Calculates the Gravitational Potential: It uses a Fast Fourier Transform (FFT) to efficiently solve Poisson's equation for the gravitational potential (Φ) generated by this normal matter.

Applies the Causal Kernel: This is the core of the theory. It convolves the gravitational potential with a causal response kernel (Kk). This kernel models how the "information field" is sourced by the gravitational gradients of normal matter. The kernel has a characteristic length scale, ℓ (ell_kpc).

Computes the Information Density: An inverse FFT returns the resulting density of the information field (ρ_info). The strength of this effect is controlled by the branching ratio, ζ (strength).

Renders a Three-Panel Visualization: It uses Plotly to display the results in an interactive 3D view, allowing for direct comparison.

The Visualization Explained

The output is a rotating, three-panel plot showing:

Normal Matter (Left, Blue): This is the familiar disk of stars and gas that we can see. Notice how it's concentrated in a thin plane.

Information Field (Center, Red/Orange): This is the emergent "dark matter" halo generated by the model. It is more spherical, diffuse, and extends much farther out than the visible matter.

Combined (Right, Overlay): This panel shows the full picture—the visible galactic disk embedded within its larger, gravitationally dominant information halo. This combined structure is what accounts for the observed rotation curves.

Usage & Customization

Installation

Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/your-repo/info-gravity-viz.git
cd info-gravity-viz

Install the required dependencies:
pip install numpy scipy plotly

Running the Script

Execute the script from your terminal:
python visualize_info_gravity.py

An interactive Plotly window or browser tab will open with the visualization.

Experimenting with Parameters

The script's behavior is controlled by two key physical parameters defined in the paper:

ell_kpc (ℓ): The correlation length (in kiloparsecs). This determines the spatial scale of the information field. A larger ℓ results in a more diffuse, spread-out halo.

strength (ζ): The branching ratio. This is a dimensionless factor representing what fraction of erasure energy gets converted into the slow-moving information field. A higher strength creates a more massive and dominant halo.

You can modify these parameters at the bottom of the script to see how they affect the outcome:

Try different parameters:
visualize_three_panel(ell_kpc=8.0, strength=1.5)
visualize_three_panel(ell_kpc=5.0, strength=3.0)
