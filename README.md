# 🌌 Information-Gravity Coupling Visualizer  

**A Python-based numerical toy model for exploring how information erasure during galaxy formation may generate dark matter-like gravitational effects.**  

Inspired by the paper:  
**"When the Universe Deletes Data, Gravity Remembers" (Gashash, 2025)**

## 🚀 Overview  

This repository demonstrates how the **thermodynamic cost of information erasure** can lead to the emergence of a **gravitational halo**, mimicking dark matter without invoking exotic particles.  

The simulation links **information theory, energy, and gravity** into a single causal-response framework.

## The Core Hypothesis  

### 👻 The Ghost in the Galaxy  
Galaxies rotate much faster than their visible matter allows. Traditional explanations invoke **dark matter particles**. None have been detected.  

### 💡 A New Perspective: *Information is Physical*  
Information has energy costs. According to **Landauer’s Principle**, erasing one bit of information requires:  

\[
E \geq k_B T \ln(2)
\]  

### 🔗 The Causal Link: From Erasure to Emergent Gravity  
During galaxy formation, **information is erased** through:  

- Coarse-graining (microscopic → macroscopic states)  
- Decoherence (quantum → classical reality)  
- Thermalization (ordered → chaotic states)  

A fraction (**ζ**) of the erasure energy may be stored in long-lived, “dark” modes that gravitate but do not shine.
