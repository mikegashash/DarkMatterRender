# 🌌 Information-Gravity Coupling Visualizer

**A Python-based numerical toy model for exploring how information erasure during galaxy formation may generate dark-matter-like gravitational effects.**  
Companion to: **“When the Universe Deletes Data, Gravity Remembers” (Gashash, 2025)**

---

## 🚀 Overview

This repository demonstrates how the **thermodynamic cost of information erasure** can lead to the emergence of a **gravitational halo**, mimicking dark matter without invoking exotic particles. The simulation links **information theory, energy, and gravity** into a single causal-response framework.

## 🧩 The Core Hypothesis

### 👻 The Ghost in the Galaxy
Galaxies rotate much faster than their visible matter allows. Traditional explanations invoke **dark matter particles**—none have been detected definitively.

### 💡 A New Perspective: *Information is Physical*
Information has energy costs. According to **Landauer’s Principle**, erasing one bit of information requires:

\[
E \ge k_B\,T\,\ln 2
\]

### 🔗 The Causal Link: From Erasure to Emergent Gravity
During galaxy formation, **information is erased** through:

- Coarse-graining (microscopic → macroscopic states)
- Decoherence (quantum → classical reality)
- Thermalization (ordered → chaotic states)

A fraction **ζ** of the erasure energy may be stored in long-lived, “dark” modes that gravitate but do not shine.
